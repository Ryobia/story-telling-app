# Story Telling App ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL-blue)

## Description 
  We are building a collaborative story telling platform in which users can post stories for others to add to. The maker of the post can decide rules for how many words other users may add to their story. User's can comment on, or extend pre-exsisting stories based on the original authors ruleset. The user can filter postes based on genere, family-friendly, with images, or by date added, to enhance their user experience. Deployed to Heroku [Here](https://desolate-harbor-29412.herokuapp.com/)
